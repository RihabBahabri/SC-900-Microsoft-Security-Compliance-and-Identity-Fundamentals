## WWL Tenants - Terms of use

If you are being provided with a tenant as a part of an instructor-led training delivery, please note that the tenant is made available for the purpose of supporting the hands-on labs in the instructor-led training.

Tenants should not be shared or used for purposes outside of hands-on labs. The tenant used in this course is a trial tenant and cannot be used or accessed after the class is over and are not eligible for extension.

Tenants must not be converted to a paid subscription. Tenants obtained as a part of this course remain the property of Microsoft Corporation and we reserve the right to obtain access and repossess at any time.

## Pre-Demo Setup of the Microsoft 365 Tenant

### Enable Microsoft 365 audit log

In this setup task, you'll enable the Audit log capability in Microsoft 365.  Although documentation indicates that audit log is turned on by default, most lab tenants don't have this feature enabled, and it can take several hours for this to take effect.  It's beneficial to enable this feature, as Microsoft 365 uses audit logs for user insights and activities identified in policies and analytics insights.

1. Open Microsoft Edge. In the address bar, enter **https://admin.microsoft.com**.

1. Sign in with the admin credentials for the Microsoft 365 tenant provided by your authorized lab hoster (ALH).

1. From the left navigation pane of the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Show all**.

1. Under Admin centers, select **Compliance**.  A new browser page opens to the welcome page of the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.  

1. From the left navigation panel of the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, select **Show all**.

1. In the left navigation panel, under solutions, select **Audit**.  Note: the audit functionality is also accessible through the Microsoft 365 Defender home page.

1. Verify that the **Search** tab is selected (underlined).

1. Once you land on the Audit page, wait 2-3 minutes.  If Auditing is NOT enabled, you'll see a blue bar on the top of the page that says start recording user and admin activity.  Select **Start recording user and admin activity**.  Once auditing is enabled, the blue bar disappears.  If the blue bar is not present, then auditing is already enabled, and no further action is required.

1. Return to the home page of the Microsoft Purview compliance portal by selecting **Home** from the left navigation panel.

### Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps file monitoring

In this setup task, you will enable file monitoring in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.

1. Open the browser tab for the Microsoft 365 admin center.  If you previously closed it, open a new browser tab and in the address bar, enter **https://admin.microsoft.com** and from the left navigation pane of the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Show all**.

1. Under Admin centers, select **Security**.  A new browser page opens to the welcome page of the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.  

1. From the left navigation panel, select **Files**, which is listed under Cloud apps.

1. If not already enabled, you'll need to select **Enable file monitoring** and select the box next to where it says **Enable file monitoring** then select **Save**.  

1. From the left navigation panel, under cloud apps, select **Files** to return to the files page.  If you successfully enabled file monitoring, you should see the filter options on the top of the page.  It may take some time for files from the pre-configured lab tenant to be displayed.

## Pre-Demo setup of the Azure Cloud Slice Subscription

For this setup you are using the Azure Cloud Slice environment which is separate than the Microsoft 365 tenant provided. Logout of the Microsoft 365 Tenant and login using the Azure Cloud Slice credentials.

### Azure virtual machine

Check that a VM has already been created. If not, then set it up now. You will use the VM as part of the NSG demo.
